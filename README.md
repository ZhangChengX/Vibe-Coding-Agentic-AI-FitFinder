# Vibe-Coding-Agentic-AI-FitFinder

FitFinder is a thrift-shopping assistant that takes a user's request for a secondhand item and returns a real listing plus a styled outfit. The agent first calls search_listings to filter the dataset by the user's description, size, and max price; if matches come back, it passes the top result and the user's wardrobe to suggest_outfit to generate a styling idea, then feeds that outfit into create_fit_card to produce the final shareable caption. If search_listings returns nothing, the agent stops and tells the user what to loosen (broaden the description, raise the price, or change the size) rather than calling suggest_outfit with empty input, and likewise if the wardrobe is empty, it suggests the item solo instead of inventing pairings.

## The Mock Listings Dataset

`data/listings.json` contains 40 mock secondhand listings across categories (tops, bottoms, outerwear, shoes, accessories) and styles (vintage, y2k, grunge, cottagecore, streetwear, and more).

Each listing has: `id`, `title`, `description`, `category`, `style_tags`, `size`, `condition`, `price`, `colors`, `brand`, and `platform`.

Load it with:
```python
from utils.data_loader import load_listings
listings = load_listings()
```

## The Wardrobe Schema

`data/wardrobe_schema.json` defines the format your agent uses to represent a user's existing wardrobe. It includes:

- `schema`: field definitions for a wardrobe item
- `example_wardrobe`: a sample wardrobe with 10 items you can use for testing
- `empty_wardrobe`: a starting template for a new user

Load an example wardrobe with:
```python
from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe
wardrobe = get_example_wardrobe()
```

## Where to Start

1. **Read `planning.md` and fill it out before writing any code.**
2. Verify the data loads correctly by running `python utils/data_loader.py`.
3. Build and test each tool individually before connecting them through your planning loop.

Your implementation files go in this same directory. There's no required file structure for your agent code — organize it however makes sense for your design.
